#                  Pickle Module and Try/Except Python Scripts


## Introduction

In this assignment, I will go over how to use the pickle module with python to serialize data. Also, I will show how to capture and trap errors with a try/except loop/block. I will be creating the script using Python3, PyCharm CE and macOS


## Coming up with the Code

To write my code, I used PyCharm CE - a popular python programming editor/application.

I decided to demonstrate both new concepts for this assignment in 2 different scripts. First, with the Pickle module, pickling is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. With Pickling, an object can be serialized and then de-serialized to be transferred to another Python script and/or written and then read back from a file.

With Try/Except, we first use try to execute any code we want - in this assignment I use Try/Except as a loop to check for errors. We can use the except part of the loop to trap any error that may happen with our try code. I have used Try/Except in a few assignments already this year and like a good programmer, I wanted to re-use some code that was already written.


## How the Code Works

First up, let’s look at our Pickle example. I kept the code as simple as possible to just be able to spell out quickly how the Pickle Module works and functions. Below is a screenshot of my Pickle code:
